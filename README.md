# TableTop
How to run the program:

1. Start the TableTopServer (\TableTop\TableTop\TableTopServer\bin\Debug\TableTopServer.exe)
2. Open the TableTop Client (\TableTop\TableTop\TableTop\bin\Debug\TableTop.exe)
3. Input a user name and the IP (For testing it'll be "127.0.0.1:8733")
4. Check the "Connect as GM" box, and connect
5. Now you can connect as players now that there's a GM

Note: GM is not working right now in a lot of ways, but server can handle multiple client connections and they can do shit.
